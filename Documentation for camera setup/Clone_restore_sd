Follow these instructions if you are having troubles and want to clone a fresh raspian image to an SD card:

1.) Plug micro USB adapter with recovery image into computer

2.) Run 'dmesg', you should see a drive name (eg. /sdb) associated to the newly connected USB drive in the newest lines of the dmesg log.

3.) Change /sdb in the following command to the drive name you found in step 2, it might still be /sdb. Also specify the path where you 
    want to save the drive image

	sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdb | gzip > /home/your_username/Desktop/image`date +%d%m%y`.gz

4.) Run the above command in the terminal. The process can take 15 to 20 minutes. You will know when it is done when you will be able to enter 
    commands into the terminal again. Also, monitor the progress in "System monitor" with the gzip process, it is done when the gzip process goes away.

5.) You now have a fully configured Raspian image. You can now remove the recovery card from the USB/sd adapter and place in a new card or
    an old reformatted card. Then run 'dmesg' to double check the name of the adapter. Then run the following command with the correct paths and
    USB adapter name:

	sudo gzip -dc /home/your_username/imageXXXXXX.gz | sudo dd bs=4M of=/dev/sdb

6.) This image should work when inserted into a raspberry pi. It will have a 192.168.0.1 ip address. To connect to it over ssh make sure
    any other raspberry pi with 192.168.0.1 is not connected. Then you will need to change the ip address.

with,

sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces


make sure your new ip address is properly set and that everything looks similar to this:

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.0.10  <------set ip address here, ex. 192.168.0.3
netmask 255.255.255.0
broadcast 192.168.0.255
