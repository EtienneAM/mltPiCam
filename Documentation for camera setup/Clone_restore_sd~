Notes on SD card management:

Cloning an image of the raspberry Pi:

This command places a compressed image of the disk where ever you want it on your computer.

sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdb | gzip > /home/your_username/image`date +%d%m%y`.gz

Restore to a fresh card (make sure to change the card and use the right path):

sudo gzip -dc /home/your_username/image.gz | sudo dd bs=4M of=/dev/sdb


*the whole process
