Step 1:

Make sure that there is a directory named .ssh on the Rpi

Step 2:

Create a file inside .ssh called authorized_keys (save and exit, but make sure it actually created the file)

Step 3:

Make sure you have a id_rsa.pub file which can be generated using: ssh-keygen -t rsa -C eben@pi. The last argument in this file (eben@pi) can be anything you want it to be, but chose something sensible (e.g. jason@control_desktop).

Step 4:

ssh-copy-id pi@192.168.0.XX (This copies the id_rsa.pub file from the host to the remote machine)

Here you will be prompted to enter the password to connect one last time. After it does what it does make sure everything works by trying to connect again to the pi using ssh. If you are not prompted for a password then everything is all good.
