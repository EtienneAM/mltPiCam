This is how to set up a network stream:

Make sure mplayer is installed:

Run this on the desktop:

nc -l -p 8000 | mplayer -vo xv -fps 24 -cache 512 -

Run this on the pi:

raspivid -w 300 -h 300 -fps 10 -t 600000 -o - | nc 192.168.0.200 8000


Everything should run smoothly, this first (Desktop) listens for signals from the second (Rpi)
